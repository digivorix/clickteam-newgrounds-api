-Newgrounds.io API for Clickteam Fusion 2.5-


This is a wrapper that makes use of a Javascript version of the Newgrounds API that was written by KilledByAPixel.



To get started, read the included Newgrounds_API.pdf file. This contains information on the wrapper and how to set it up inside of Clickteam Fusion.


BasicPlatformer.mfa is a small example which shows the API in action. Be sure to reference it if you are stuck.



This implimentation will work with any version of Clickteam Fusion 2.5 (Free, Standard, or Developer).

NOTE: If you have Fusion 2.5 Standard or Developer, you will need the HTML5 Export Module, since it contains the HTML5 object. The free version of the exporter that is bundled with Fusion will work as well.
